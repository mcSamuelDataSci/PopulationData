# PopulationData

This repository is for sharing CDPH Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) documents and code related to informal traning and information for sources of population data for groups working on population health in California.

Note that the contents of the file "P3_complete.zip" in the "data_in" folder must be unzipped to the same folder for the R code "get and process DOF data.R" to work. The contents of the zipped file "P3_Complete.csv" is too large to store on this GitHub repository.
